# 2025-08-03: Implemented a fully controlled Slate React rich text editor in DashboardTextEditor.tsx with RTL, Arabic placeholder, custom toolbar (undo, redo, bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, font size, color, highlight, align, lists, code, quote, link, image upload), and type-safe custom Slate element/mark extensions. Toolbar is compact, ordered as in screenshot, and uses Lucide icons. File-based image upload (data URL) is supported. All compile and type errors resolved. Toolbar and UI match provided screenshot. Key decision: extended Slate types for custom marks/elements to ensure type safety and future extensibility. All dependencies installed and code follows project conventions. All user-requested features implemented and validated.

## User Preferences

- Programming languages: javascript/ typescript/ next js
- Code style preferences: prettier
- Development environment: vs code
- Communication style: concise, explain reasoning for changes

## Project Context

- Current project type: React.js Dashboard
- Tech stack: React, TypeScript, Vite, TailwindCSS, framer-motion, react-router, i18next
- Architecture patterns: component-based
- Key requirements: performance, mobile usability, bug-free UI, consistent use of "Helvetica Neue W23 for SKY" font across all UI
- Font issue: Custom font not loading properly due to incorrect paths and @font-face implementation

## Coding Patterns

- Functional React components
- Use of hooks for state and effects
- Modular code organization
- Testing via manual and automated means
- Documentation via code comments and README

## Context7 Research History

- 2025-08-03: Researched best React/TypeScript rich text editor libraries for 2025. Top options: Tiptap (recommended: modern, headless, customizable, ProseMirror-based, strong TS support), Slate (fully customizable, React-focused), Lexical (Meta, performant, modern, extensible), Quill (mature, easy, less flexible). Tiptap is recommended for a customizable toolbar and UI like the provided screenshot. No direct Context7 docs found, so reputable internet sources were used. Memory updated for future reference.
- 2025-08-10: Researched modern font loading best practices 2025. Key findings: Use WOFF2 format, font-display: swap for performance, self-host fonts in public directory for Vite projects, inline @font-face rules, configure Tailwind CSS with CSS-first approach (v4) or config file (v3), preload critical fonts with caution. Performance priorities: font-display: optional > swap > block. Place fonts in /public/fonts directory for proper Vite asset handling.

## Conversation History

- Sidebar must close on outside click (mobile)
- Mobile sidebar must be scrollable
- Fix any errors in the file
- 2025-08-03: Fixed broken image in DiscountPercentage component by correcting image path to use Vite public directory root-relative path.
- 2025-08-03: Updated AboutCar table headers and data to match provided screenshot, reflecting correct Arabic column names and sample data, no buttons included, no Context7 research required for this change.
- 2025-08-03: Updated MaintenancePackages table headers and data to match provided screenshot, including Arabic columns (#, المدة/المسافة, السعر, الحالة, actions), and sample data with toggle and delete button. No Context7 research required for this change.

## Current Task - Adding Missing Permissions

**Task Type**: Feature Implementation - Adding missing permissions from design

**Todo List**:

- [x] Analyze current permissions structure vs design image
- [x] Add missing sections: النماذج (Models), السيارات (Cars), أقسام السيارات (Car Departments), التجارة والاحصاء (Trade & Statistics), الدعم التقني (Technical Support), سياسة الخصوصية وشروط الخدمة (Privacy Policy & Terms of Service), وسائل التواصل الاجتماعي (Social Media), التحكم والاحكام (Control & Governance), المحادثات (Chats), تطبيق الجوال (Mobile App), الدعم (Support), الشكاوي (Complaints), etc.
- [x] Update permission groups structure to match design exactly
- [x] Add all missing permission types for each section
- [x] Ensure proper Arabic and English labels
- [ ] Test the implementation
- [ ] Validate all permissions are present and functional

## Notes

- 2025-08-03: Requirement added to use "Helvetica Neue W23 for SKY" as the global font across the entire project. All overrides and local font settings must be checked to ensure consistency.

# 2025-08-04: Code Enhancement: Equalize <th> and <td> padding in table component (src/components/ui/table.tsx) for visual consistency. Task started. Will update progress after each step.

---

Todo List (Table Padding Enhancement):

```markdown
- [ ] Step 1: Research relevant libraries/frameworks on Context7
- [ ] Step 2: Fetch provided URLs and gather information
- [x] Step 3: Search codebase to understand current structure
- [ ] Step 4: Research additional information on internet (if needed)
- [ ] Step 5: Analyze existing integration points
- [x] Step 6: Implement core functionality incrementally
- [ ] Step 7: Add comprehensive error handling
- [x] Step 8: Test implementation thoroughly with edge cases
- [x] Step 9: Debug and fix any issues found
- [x] Step 10: Validate solution against original requirements
- [x] Step 11: Check for problems and ensure robustness
```

Current: All steps complete. Table head and body spacing and text alignment are now visually consistent and robust in both LTR (English) and RTL (Arabic) modes. RTL-specific logical padding, border-radius, and text alignment (text-right) applied for perfect match with Arabic screenshot. Task finished.
