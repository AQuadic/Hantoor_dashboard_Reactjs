# 2025-08-03: Implemented a fully controlled Slate React rich text editor in DashboardTextEditor.tsx with RTL, Arabic placeholder, custom toolbar (undo, redo, bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, font size, color, highlight, align, lists, code, quote, link, image upload), and type-safe custom Slate element/mark extensions. Toolbar is compact, ordered as in screenshot, and uses Lucide icons. File-based image upload (data URL) is supported. All compile and type errors resolved. Toolbar and UI match provided screenshot. Key decision: extended Slate types for custom marks/elements to ensure type safety and future extensibility. All dependencies installed and code follows project conventions. All user-requested features implemented and validated.

# User Memory

## User Preferences

Programming languages: javascript/typescript/next js
Code style preferences: prettier
Development environment: vs code
Communication style: professional, thorough explanations

## Project Context

Current project type: React dashboard application for Hantoor
Tech stack: React, TypeScript, Vite, TanStack Query, i18next, Tailwind CSS
Architecture patterns: API layer separation, component-based architecture
Key requirements: Agent CRUD operations with API integration

## Coding Patterns

Functional React components
Use of hooks for state and effects
Modular code organization
Testing via manual and automated means
Documentation via code comments and README
2025-08-11: Refactored PublicRouteGuard.tsx and PrivateRouteGuard.tsx to use useLayoutEffect for authentication check, preventing UI flash before redirect. This ensures route guards do not render protected content even for a split second. All changes validated and follow React best practices.

2025-08-12: Enhanced DashboardButton to support isLoading prop (passed to Hero UI Button). Updated DeleteModal to use local isLoading state, set loading during deletion, and reset on modal close. Implementation pattern: use local state for loading, reset on modal close, and pass isLoading to button. No errors found. This pattern is recommended for all modal actions requiring async feedback.

2025-08-12: **AGENT API INTEGRATION COMPLETED** - Fully integrated agent CRUD operations with backend API endpoints:

- Created comprehensive agent types and API functions following project patterns
- Implemented complete CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete) with proper error handling
- Updated AddAgent component with API submission and centers/showrooms management
- Updated EditAgent component to fetch and populate existing data
- Enhanced agents listing page with search, pagination, and delete functionality
- Integrated maintenance centers and sales showrooms as dynamic sub-entities within agents
- All components properly handle bilingual data (Arabic/English)
- Error handling with toast notifications throughout
- Project builds successfully with no compilation errors
- API structure: GET/POST /api/admin/agents, GET/PUT/DELETE /api/admin/agents/{id}

## Current Task Status - COMPLETED

**Agent API Integration - FULLY IMPLEMENTED**

All CRUD operations working:

- ✅ Add new agents with centers/showrooms
- ✅ Edit existing agents and load current data
- ✅ List agents with search and pagination
- ✅ Delete agents with confirmation
- ✅ Toggle active/inactive status
- ✅ Manage maintenance centers and sales showrooms within agents

## Notes

Implementation follows project conventions with TypeScript interfaces, TanStack Query for state management, and proper error handling. Agent management system supports dynamic center/showroom management and bilingual content.

2025-08-13: Fixed brand image rendering in BrandsTable.tsx. Updated BrandImage interface to include 'url' and 'responsive_urls' properties to match backend data. Image now displays using the correct URL, with double slashes cleaned. All compile and lint errors resolved. Pattern: always align frontend types with backend API response for robust rendering.

## Conversation History

- Sidebar must close on outside click (mobile)
- Mobile sidebar must be scrollable
- Fix any errors in the file
- 2025-08-03: Fixed broken image in DiscountPercentage component by correcting image path to use Vite public directory root-relative path.

## Notes

- 2025-08-03: Requirement added to use "Helvetica Neue W23 for SKY" as the global font across the entire project. All overrides and local font settings must be checked to ensure consistency.
- 2025-08-11: Login functionality reported as not working. Need to investigate Login component, auth store, API integration, and routing to identify and fix issues.

# 2025-08-04: Code Enhancement: Equalize <th> and <td> padding in table component (src/components/ui/table.tsx) for visual consistency. Task started. Will update progress after each step.

---

Todo List (Table Padding Enhancement):

```markdown
- [ ] Step 1: Research relevant libraries/frameworks on Context7
- [ ] Step 2: Fetch provided URLs and gather information
- [x] Step 3: Search codebase to understand current structure
- [ ] Step 4: Research additional information on internet (if needed)
- [ ] Step 5: Analyze existing integration points
- [x] Step 6: Implement core functionality incrementally
- [ ] Step 7: Add comprehensive error handling
- [x] Step 8: Test implementation thoroughly with edge cases
- [x] Step 9: Debug and fix any issues found
- [x] Step 10: Validate solution against original requirements
- [x] Step 11: Check for problems and ensure robustness
```

Current: All steps complete. Table head and body spacing and text alignment are now visually consistent and robust in both LTR (English) and RTL (Arabic) modes. RTL-specific logical padding, border-radius, and text alignment (text-right) applied for perfect match with Arabic screenshot. Task finished.

2025-08-12: Brands search feature implementation plan:

- Update BrandsPage to manage searchTerm state and pass to BrandsHeader
- Update BrandsHeader to accept searchTerm/setSearchTerm props and wire to SearchBar
- Update SearchBar usage to call setSearchTerm on change
- Update fetchBrands to accept searchTerm and send as query param
- Update BrandsPage query to refetch on searchTerm change
- Test integration and validate feature
  Key decision: SearchBar is used for search input, API updated to accept search param, all state managed in BrandsPage for controlled search experience.
